## ⚽ Football Player Market Value Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to estimate and analyze the market value of professional football players worldwide based on their performance, background, and career data.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using a comprehensive dataset containing detailed attributes of football players—such as age, nationality, position, goals, assists, playing time, and more—this project builds regression models to predict the market value (in USD) of each player.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📁 Data: Player information including:
Demographics: nationality, height, dominant foot, date of birth
Performance: goals, assists, minutes played, appearances, cards
Career metadata: current club, agent, competition level

### 🛠 ML Models Used:
Linear Regression
Ridge & Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics:
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
R² Score

## 🧠 Goals
Predict player market value based on both personal characteristics and match statistics
Compare different machine learning models to determine the most effective algorithm
Visualize patterns and insights in player value distribution

## 🧪 Example Insights
How much influence does playing time or goal count have on a player's market value?
Do agents or competitions have a measurable impact?
How well can machine learning models generalize across leagues or countries?

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python 3, Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
